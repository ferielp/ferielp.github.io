# Welcome to my website!

I am Feriel Presswalla, a first-year PhD student in the Clinical Translational Program at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. After a 9-year stint working full-time as a Research Specialist in various basic science wet labs, I am back in school to develop skills relevant to translating discoveries from the bench into bedside care. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my background, ongoing research, and publications.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:fxp124@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
